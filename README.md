https://kirstengord.github.io/100-days-of-code/

<h1>Day 58 - 6/3/21</h1>
<p>PROJECT: Portfolio site</br>
  SKILLS: JavaScript</br>
  PROGRESS: Had a suggestion to use the TypeItjs function for my typewriter effect in my titles instead of pure CSS. Checked out the website, created a new     branch of my code to try it out. I definitely need some more JS training. I did get it to work but it had a negative effect on the positioning on my page and I   couldn't figure out how to fix it or why it happened!</br>
  THOUGHTS: Really frustrating! But it was still good practice</p>

<h1>Day 57 - 5/3/21</h1>
<p>PROJECT: 100 Days of Code project page</br>
  PROGRESS: Continuing to add my backdated progress to the site and my github readme.</p>

<h1>Day 56 - 4/3/21</h1>
<p>PROJECT: Networking</br>
  Posted my portfolio site link and code link to my web dev course's Discord channel. Connected with several others on the course. Joined CodeWars. Continued to       work on 100 Days of Code project page.</br>
